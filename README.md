# Artificial Neural Network for Flood Prediction

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the *Index Flood* based on environmental features such as area, wetness, and other parameters from hydrological datasets. The network leverages modular code organization, enabling customization and scalability.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Organized into distinct modules for data processing, model training, prediction, and visualization.
- **Customizable ANN**: Hyperparameters like hidden layers, epochs, and learning rates can be adjusted in a configuration file (`config/config.py`).
- **Data Standardization**: Implements robust data preprocessing for improved model performance.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Plots for validation errors and predicted vs. actual floods are generated using `plotly`.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and correlation coefficients for model evaluation.
- **Comparison Tool**: Compare ANN predictions with external data (e.g., LINEST predictions) using a provided Excel file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link.git
    cd artificial-neural-network
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install the requirements:

    ```bash
   uv sync
    ```

4. Place the required Excel files (`FEHDataStudent.xlsx` and `compare-data.xlsx`) in the `data` directory.

---

## Usage

1. **Train the Model**: Run the main script to process the data, train the model, and visualize results:

    ```bash
    python ann.py
    ```

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, hidden layer size, and number of epochs in `config/config.py`.

3. **Compare Predictions**: To evaluate model predictions against external data (e.g., LINEST results), ensure `compare-data.xlsx` is in the `data` directory, then execute the script as usual.

4. **Output**: The script generates interactive plots and prints evaluation metrics to the console.
